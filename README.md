# Chat-Rooms-App
It is an app where logged-in users can create chat rooms. You can add other users to these chat rooms and chat with them. Chat room and messaging features have been implemented thanks to the **Socket.io**. Chat rooms along with registered users are persisted in the **Mongo DB** except messages. I've used **session cookies** for authentication. Sessions are stored in the **Redis DB**. I've written **unit tests** for the service layer and the middlewares. I've also implemented the front end of the app to experience the Socket.io on the client.
